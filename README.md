### Closing issues and PRs to avoid further harassment.

**TL;DR: Random nn gets attacked over having a bad client and config issue, copes about it on r/minecraftclients and gets publicly shamed in multiple Discord servers and DMs.**

I hope you retards dont spam mine and my friends' 69 other socials with "TL;DR" because you're clearly braindead.

I'm seriously considering suicide, I bet the community would laugh and laugh at me for it because I'm such a mentally frail wimp.  
Idgaf if you decide to friend me to send me "suicide help" resources I know you're laughing so hard irl about this. 🤣

(I blocked him because it would get even worse if I didn't)
```

Keep in mind I dont know a lot of the terms used in the conversation since I joined in 2020 and I'm really new (as said an immense fucking amount of times by Anth)  
I know that was long, but it explains a lot of the shit that happened.

# A basic summary of the stuff on the Intent discord server(s)
There was even more shit on the Intent private discord server.  
Even intent devs seemed to harass me for "malding" and being "retarded" and having "brain damage".

He also publicly shamed me on the Tenacity private discord server, maybe even Exhibition and Ketamine since he owns those too. 🤷‍♂️

This caused me to contact Nef to deactivate my Intent account.  
He was high at the time, and currently is now.


# Posting the logs on Reddit
The way everyone started shaming me on the Intent private discord server was through the post I made on r/minecraftclients.

I forgot to censor both Anth and my names, which made a lot of people from there friend me to possibly harass me?  
I had to rename my account then.  
And Anth immediately recognized me from the post and started saying something along the lines of:

```
Ofc that guy posted that because he can't cope
```

I forgot exactly what he said since I left.

# Getting comments from other platforms as well!
Something very funny happened late at night yesterday:  
Anth found my shitty youtube channel where I usually post shitposts and stuff.

He decided to make funny comments on there.

Luckily it was a brand channel and there wasn't much information to it, so I just ended up deleting it.

I also renamed my github to this 😀
The name perfectly explains what was said to me.

# My last projects EVER?
Yup! I'll be releasing a collection of Python scripts for various purposes soon. This will be my last contribution to the open-source community, and even my entire lifetime.

If you don't hear from me for a while, don't ask if I killed myself because you'd kmow the answer.

Harassment from 2 different communities in the span of 1 month has seriously took a large toll on my mental health.

# Tf happened to my other repos?
They're also gone to avoid a massive amount of harassment.  
No source code will be given to random people. You MUST be my friend to receive source code of my old projecta.`
